The script is essentially just a single line command that initiates a Telnet connection to the server "towel.blinkenlights.nl".
The command is: telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl

When you run this command in a terminal, it tells your computer to connect to the Telnet service running on the server at the address "towel.blinkenlights.nl".

Telnet is a protocol that allows you to connect to remote computers and servers over a network. It's often used for remote administration of servers, but it can also be used for fun things like streaming ASCII art movies, as in this case.

When you connect to "towel.blinkenlights.nl" using Telnet, the server sends your terminal a stream of ASCII characters that represent the Star Wars movie. Each character represents a pixel in the movie, and when displayed in sequence on your terminal, they create the illusion of motion and animation.

The ASCII art movie is actually a modified version of the original Star Wars movie, created by a group of fans. They converted the movie into ASCII art format by mapping each frame of the movie to a grid of ASCII characters, using different characters to represent different shades of gray.

So when you run this script, you're essentially just opening a Telnet connection to a server that's streaming an ASCII art version of the Star Wars movie. It's a fun little Easter egg that showcases the creativity and ingenuity of the Star Wars fandom!

But then, the towel.blinkenlights.nl server is no longer running.
However if you want to see the ipv4 version. it's still up on Telehack. telnet telehack.com and run 'starwars'. Not as cool as connecting to blinkenlights directly, but it looks just the same as far as I can tell.
